# Sleep Monitoring System
1. Record video using webcam on a laptop covering the
sleeping area of the individual
2. Consider low light conditions and perform image cleanup
for better object detection
3. Detect motion of the individual and create log of
movements with the duration of
movement & the quantum of movement
4. Plot sleeping pattern of the individual showing pattern in
timings of the movements, hours of uninterrupted sleep,
wake up time pattern etc.
